            <p class="focused">With the recent post-poning of Mineorama a group of community members, YouTubers, and server hosts have came together with the intention of making the most of the situation.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>YouCube Meetup is the result of that drive to repair what was made wrong. On July 12th we'll be hosting a fan meetup with those who originally intended to go to Mineorama. No charge. No catch. Open to everyone. We're currently looking for a facility to facilitate the event and we'll be making announcements on our Twitter as we know more.</p>
